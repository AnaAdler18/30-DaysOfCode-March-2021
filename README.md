**code_N_conquer** presented by **SRM CODECHEF NCR chapter** is an initiative to target young minds who have just stepped into coding. In this **30 day challenge**, participants will get questions on a daily basis for a duration of one month. The participants will be challenged with questions with basic concepts and this will help in maintaining a flow to their daily programming progress. Participants will commit to the repositories and post their answers to the problems provided to them.
